# Todo list application

This repo provides a simple todo application, based on a Node backend and a React frontend.

**NOTE:** This application/repo was developed specifically for the 2023 WeAreDevelopers conference. This repo will _not_ be maintained. You can use the tags in the repo to navigate through the samples.

## Development

Install the following components in order to start development.

1. Install Docker Desktop (if you don't have it yet)
1. Use Docker Compose to launch the application using `docker compose up -d`.
1. Start the Compose watcher by running `docker compose alpha watch`

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend. The backend will be running on http://localhost:3030.
