# Todo list application

This repo provides a simple todo application, based on a Node backend and a React frontend.

**NOTE:** This application/repo was developed specifically for the 2023 WeAreDevelopers conference. This repo will _not_ be maintained. You can use the tags in the repo to navigate through the samples.

## Development

Install the following components in order to start development.

1. Install Node and `npm`
1. Install MySQL and ensure it's running
1. In both the `client/` and `api/` directories, run `npm install`
1. In the `api/` directory, create a `.env` file with the following contents:

    ```
    MYSQL_HOST=localhost
    MYSQL_USER=root
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=<your-root-user-password>
    MYSQL_DB=<your-database-user>
    ``` 

1. In the `client/` directory, run `npm start` to start the frontend
1. In the `api/` directory, run `npm run dev` to start the backend

Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend. The backend will be running on http://localhost:3030.
